  <p>I'm a very proud father of 3 kiddos: McKennah, Katie and Owen. I'm married to my best friend and high school sweetheart, Melanie. She's the glue that holds the entire family together and far too good to me.</p>

  <p>Home will always be Flower Mound, Texas. We love the beach and make a yearly trip to Destin, Florida. If you ever get out that way, you have to eat at The Donut Hole and Louis Louis. As a family of Texans, we are enamored by anything with landscape variation. Our favorite non-beach spots all include mountains and snow if we can find it. We love Estes Park, CO , <a href="/photos/20230315-big-bend/">Big Bend National Park</a> and Angelfire, NM.</p>

  <p>My first car in high school was an old '92 Jeep Wrangler and I've been an enthusiast ever since. We had an '01 Wrangler when we were married, but sold it when kids came along. A few years back we found a clean '04 Rubicon. Its been fun to have a Jeep again to run around town with the kids. The next phase will be teaching them to drive the 5-speed.</p>
