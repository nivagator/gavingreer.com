  <p>I'm a very proud father of 3 kiddos: McKennah, Katie and Owen. I'm married to my best friend and high school sweetheart, Melanie. She's the glue that holds the entire family together and far too good to me.</p>

  <p>Home will always be Flower Mound, Texas. We love the beach and make a yearly trip to Destin, Florida. If you ever get out that way, you have to eat at The Donut Hole and Louis Louis. This year we're taking a trip to Estes Park, Colorado and will do some hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>

  <p>I have been a Texas Rangers baseball fan since before I can remember. I love baseball. The strategy behind every pitch, the skill required to pitch and hit at the major league level is incredible. I love the numbers, records, metrics and analytics behind the sport.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-site">About This Site</h2>

<p>This site (or, more accurately, the content at this URL) has been in some phase of development for more than decade. It seems I would always bite off more than my abilities and time would allow. This is my attempt to finally get a website, professional resume and blog together all in one place and learn some things along the way.</p>

<p>This site is hosted with <a href="https://www.linode.com">Linode</a> on a VM running Ubuntu and served by Nginx. The site is generated with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. I started by using the <a href="https://github.com/yous/whiteglass">whiteglass</a> theme, but have since customized and moved to a local installation. Source code for this site can be found <a href="https://www.github.com/">here</a>. I'm using Git Hooks to publish remotely.</p>
