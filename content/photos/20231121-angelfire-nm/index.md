We took a trip to the mountains over Thanksgiving 2023 with just our five. We stayed in a ski condo before ski season started. Lots of hiking and a really interesting Thanksgiving meal experience that we will remember forever. We took an evening and drove up to Red River and were able to tube on the ski slopes!
