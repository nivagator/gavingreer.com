August 5th, 2024

On this year's annual family trip to Destin, FL, we stayed overnight in Mobile on the drive down. We took time to go see the USS Alabama battleship and the USS Drum submarine which are docked as museum pieces in the bay. I loved every minute of it. It was hard to believe these vessels were built in the 1940s!
