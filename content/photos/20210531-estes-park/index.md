This was one of my all time favorite trips. Rocky Mountain National Park is gorgeous. Still very early in the season, it was cold and there was plenty of snow on the trails, but the hikes were fantastic. We rented a Jeep one day and found trails locally to run. On the way(ish) home, we stopped at the Great Sand Dunes National Park for the afternoon. Great trip, we will do this again someday.
