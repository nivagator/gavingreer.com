Spring Break 2023 with the family to Big Bend National Park. My parents joined us for this trip. We stayed in Marathon, TX which is the closest you can be to the park without staying on the grounds and was still an hour drive out. We saw a new, fantastic sunrise each morning on the drive in. This was a great trip. We left just in time too. The park got 6-8" of snow the day after we left!
