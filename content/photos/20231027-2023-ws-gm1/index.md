My father-in-law took me and my brother-in-law to Game 1 of the 2023 World Series to see the Texas Rangers take on the Arizona Diamondbacks. This game was incredible and produced one of the most iconic Corey Seager moments of his career with a home run in the bottom of the 9th to tie it. Adolis Garcia would go on to hit a walk off home run.

We got there early enough pre-game to go down to field level. A lot of these pictures are from there. 

The BBQ pictures were from Hurtado Barbecue in Arlington before the game.
